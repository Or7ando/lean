# Schemes in Lean

The content of this repository is the result of completely refactoring the [lean-stacks-project](https://github.com/kbuzzard/lean-stacks-project), in which parts of [The Stacks Project](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/) are formally verified using the [Lean Theorem Prover](https://leanprover.github.io/). In particular, some bits of Chapters 6, 10 and 25 are formalized, culminating with the definition of a [scheme](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/01II). Having learnt from the many problems encountered in that first attempt, we present a cleaner and more robust approach. The main improvements are:

* The definition of a locally ringed space. Even though a scheme is technically a locally ringed space with a certain property, the previous definition, which is mathematically equivalent, did not involve locally ringed spaces.
* The use of the `is_localization` predicate, defined by Prof Neil Strickland [here](https://github.com/NeilStrickland/lean_comm_alg/blob/master/src/localization.lean), throughout instead of the concrete construction of a localized ring. Thanks to this, we avoided complicated arguments about *canonically isomorphic* rings.
* Usability. We have re-structured the previous repository and re-named all the files and many of the definitions and lemmas with the intention of providing a usable interface.

Note that this is still very much a work in progress. The API needs to be tested with more examples of schemes and constructions involving schemes.

## Content

This is a general overview of the maths that you can find in this repository.

In the `sheaves` directory we have:
* Presheaves of sets and of rings on a topological space and on a basis. Similarly, we define sheaves and stalks and prove some basic lemmas about them.
* The construction of the extension of a presheaf on a basis to a presheaf on the whole space with the usual properties.
* Locally ringed spaces.

Then, in `spectrum_of_a_ring`, there is:
* The definition of the topological space Spec(R) together with some general properties such as compactness and some lemmas about the basic opens.
* The structure presheaf defined on the basic opens and the proof of the sheaf property, which spans several files.
* The proof that Spec(R) is a locally ringed space.

Finally, a scheme is defined in `scheme.lean` and two examples (the empty scheme and affine schemes) are provided in `instances`. There is also a `to_mathlib` directory with some general results that we found useful. 

## Installation

To get it working, you will need Lean 3.4.2, available [here](https://github.com/leanprover/lean/releases/tag/v3.4.2). Clone the repository and type:

```
cd lean-scheme
leanpkg configure
leanpkg build
```
